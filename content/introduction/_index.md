### What is Amazon Lightsail

Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started in the cloud. Lightsail provides compute, storage, and networking at a low fixed price. But, it doesn't stop there, your Lightsail instances are built on and can leverage the power of the rest of services that AWS offers. This means that you can start building more quickly than ever before, but are not limited in what you can do long term.
